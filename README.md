### Problem Statements:
#### Problem 5: Question: [Practice Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-regex/problem) 
Write a class called MyRegex which will contain a string pattern. You need to write a regular expression and assign it to the pattern such that it can be used to validate an IP address. Use the following definition of an IP address:  
`IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", where the value of A, B, C, and D may range from 0 to 255. Leading zeros are allowed. The length of A, B, C, or D can't be greater than 3.`  
#### Some valid IP address:  
000.12.12.034  
121.234.12.12  
23.45.12.56  
#### Some invalid IP address:  
000.12.234.23.23  
666.666.23.23
